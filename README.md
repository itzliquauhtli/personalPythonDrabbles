stuff i made for no reason other than bored

### a02_itzliquauhtli.py

someone i knew was explaining their python homework to me, which was to make a program which satisfied the following conditions;

  - used turtle graphics to draw to the screen
  - used multiple turtles
  - used recursion or some other self-referential function

i thought it was an interesting prompt so i wrote this, which uses 8 turtles (affectionately named Adam, Brian, Charlie, David, Evan, Fred, Gilbert, and Harry) to draw Koch snowflakes in various colors, using the Tue-Morse sequence

### battleship.py

exactly what it says on the tin, this runs a game of battleship in the python terminal. has a barrage mode, where each turn the players take a number of shots equal to their unsunk ships, as well as a classic mode. also features an option to randomly place your ships, mostly because placing them via command line every time i waas testing was annoying. the enemy ai is shit because i wrote this in high school and i couldnt be bothered to make anything better than "take shots at random and hope for the best"

### catenativeDoomsdayDiceCascader.py

monte carlo sim to estimate the average damage of a dice-based weapon from a webcomic. for more information, read the comments i left in the file itself

### pigAdvantage.py

another monte carlo sim, this time for the game pig, but where you roll 2d6kh1 (two six-sided dice, keeping the highest one) instead of 1d6 (one six-sided die). itll play the game a bunch of times and print each games result to the console. then it prints the percentage of all games where it didnt bust
