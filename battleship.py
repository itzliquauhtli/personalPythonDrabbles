##Battleship by itzliquauhtli
##
##version 1.0.0 finished 04/13/2019
##
##The classic pen-and-paper game implemented in the python console because I got bored in class.
##Single Player, with a dumb ai opponent.
##Designed with flexibility in mind, with ocean size and ships configurable.

from random import randrange, randint
from copy import copy

##Functions;
##
##printList( arr arr ):
##    Prints all elements of a list, used for debuging
##emptyBoard( str tile , int x , int y ):
##    Returns a 2d array of dimmensions x by y.
##    All elements are the tile string, which is usually the "sea" variable
##    Used to generate the initial board, before filling it with ships.
##print2dArray( arr board ):
##    Prints a 2d array to the console.
##displaySingle( arr board ):
##    Makes a board with axis labels above and to the right, then prints it to the screen.
##displayDual( arr boardP , arr boardO ):
##    Calls displaySingle twice, makes the main program a bit neater
##getCoord():
##    Prompts the user for a coordinate on the board. Expects standard battleship names
##    (i.e. E5, F8, a1, etc.) Can be lowercase or uppercase.
##    Returns an array [ y , x ] for use in targeting
##getCoordRand( int y , int x ):
##    Returns a random coordinate of form [ y , x ]
##binaryPrompt( str prompt , str pos , str neg )
##    Asks the user a binary question.
##    Return true if answer equals pos, false if neg, and loops if anything else.
##placeValidate( board , ship , tile , aim , ort )
##    Makes sure the ship fits where the user has placed it. Returns an int based on the result of the check;
##        Returns 0 if the check found no issues with the placement
##        Returns 1 if the ship overlaps with another
##        Returns 2 if the ship runs off the edge of the board.
##placeVtc( arr board , arr ship , arr aim ):
##    Run through the board array and change each tile in the ship's path to the appropriate tile. For vertical use only.
##    Returns the modified board array.
##placeHrz( arr board , arr ship , arr aim ):
##    Run through the board array and change each tile in the ship's path to the appropriate tile. For horizontal use only.
##    Returns the modified board array.
##placeCombined( board , ship , aim , ort )
##    One function that runs either placeVtc or placeHrz depending on ort value.
##    Literally just lets manPlaceShip and randPlaceShip look a lot neater.
##    Returns the modified board array.
##manPlaceShip( arr board , arr ship , str tile ):
##    Allows the player to manually place one ship on their board by specifying the closest square to the origin, and wether it is horizontal 
##    or vertical.
##    Returns the board array, modified with the ship's tiles in the proper place.
##manFullPlace( arr board , arr ships , str tile ):
##    One function to run through the list of ships and prompt the user to place all of them.
##    Returns the board array, modified with all of the ships' tiles.
##randPlaceShip( arr board , arr ship , str tile ):
##    Same as manPlaceShip, but done with random values for the coordinates and orientation.
##    Returns the board array, modified with the ship's tiles.
##randFullPlace( arr board , arr ships , str tile ):
##    Same as manualFullPlace, but calling randPlaceShip rather than manPlaceShip. Works entirely in the background.
##    Returns the board array, modified with all of the ships' tiles.
##pBoardSetup( str tile , int y , int x ):
##    Fully sets up the player's initial board using the above functions. 
##    First, asks if the player would like to manually place ships, or randomize their setup, then calls the appropriate ___FullPlace function.
##    Once the called function resolves, displays the board and prompts the user to confirm their starting positions.
##    Loops until this confirmation is given.
##    Returns the complete board, ready to start the game.
##getShips( arr board , arr ships )
##    Gets an array of ships with locations from a board with displayed ships. 
##    Returns an array of ships. See the ship_list comment for information on the structure.
##oFullSetup( arr board , arr ships , str tile ):
##    Randomly sets a board up for the opponent, records the ship positions, then clears the board for gameplay
##hitDetect( arr ship , arr shot , bool isPlayer ):
##    Checks if a given shot intersects with one ship. Returns true if a hit is detected, false if it's a miss
##pSingleFire( arr board , arr ships , str h , str m ):
##    Ask the player for a coordinate, and run through a list of ships to check if it's a hit.
##    Replaces the coordinate with a hit or miss tile, depending on the result.
##oSingleFire( arr board , arr ships , str h , str m ):
##    This is literally the worst possible AI immaginable, I'm not even sure this counts as AI, i made no attempt
##    to make it smart, it just picks random coordinates, checks if its fired there before, then if it hasnt, hits fire.
##getShotNum( arr ships , bool isPlayer ):
##    For Barrage mode, tells the two following function how many shots to allow each combatant
##pBarrage( arr board , arr ships , str h , str m ):
##    Player Barrage, prompts the player for a number of coordinates equal to the number of ships they still control.
##oBarrage( arr board , arr ships , str h , str m ):
##    Same as pBarrage, but picks coordinates randomly and fires for the opponent AI
##checkGameOver( arr ships , bool isPlayer ):
##    Function to check whether either combatant has sunk the last of their opponent's ships. 
##    Ends the game in the main loop
